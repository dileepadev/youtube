⚠️ A valid credit card is required for identity verification, but no charges will be made unless the subscription is upgraded.

⚠️ A small temporary authorization hold (not a charge) may be placed on your credit card for verification, typically removed within 3-5 days. This verifies the card's validity and is not an actual charge. If you encounter issues or believe the hold is a real charge, verify your billing address, try a different browser, ensure your account details are correct, and contact Azure Support for assistance.

Perfect for developers, students, and beginners looking to test and learn cloud services with no upfront cost.
